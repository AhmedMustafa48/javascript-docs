The event loop is a key part of the JavaScript engine that helps manage the execution of code, especially asynchronous tasks like timers, promises, and events.

Call Stack: The event loop checks if the call stack (where JavaScript code runs) is empty.
Callback Queue: If the call stack is empty, it moves tasks from the callback queue (like setTimeout callbacks) to the call stack so they can be executed.
In simple terms, the event loop ensures JavaScript handles tasks in the right order, making it possible to do multiple things without blocking the main thread.
