SHALLOW COPY:

A shallow copy creates a new object, but only copies references for nested objects or arrays. This means modifying nested properties in one object will affect the other, since both objects share the same reference.

const obj1 = { name: "Alice", details: { age: 25 } };

// Shallow copy using spread operator
const obj2 = { ...obj1 };

obj2.details.age = 30; // Modifies obj1 as well

console.log(obj1.details.age); // 30 ðŸ˜² (unexpected change)
console.log(obj2.details.age); // 30
