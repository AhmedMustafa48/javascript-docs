In JavaScript, a datatype means the kind of information you can store in a variable. For example, numbers, text (words or sentences), or true/false values are all different types of data. Datatypes help the computer understand what kind of information itâ€™s working with.


Two Types of datatypes in JavaScript
1. Primitive
2. Non Primitive
