- block scoped{}, this mean variable declared with const is only accessible within the block it is defined in.


- CANNOT redeclare in the same scope.

- CANNOT REASSIGN a value after it has been declared.

- HOISTED but they are not initiallized, accessing them before declaration results in REFERENCE ERROR, this is due to TEMPORAL DEAD ZONE.

- IMMUTABILITY:
                Declaring a variable with const does not make the value immutable. For example, objects or arrays declared with const can still have their contents modified, though the reference itself cannot be reassigned.
