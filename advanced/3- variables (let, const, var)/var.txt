- var is function-scoped. This means a var variable is accessible throughout the function in which it is declared, even before its  declaration due to hoisting.

- If declared outside a function, it becomes a property of the global window object (in browsers).

- CANNOT redeclare in the same scope.

- You can REASSIGN a value after it has been declared.

- var declarations are HOISTED to the top of their scope. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization. So, accessing the variable before initialization gives undefined.
