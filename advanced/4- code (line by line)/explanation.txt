=======================================  VISUALIZE MEMORY CREATION PHASE 

All variables will reserve space in memory with "undefined" value. 
 --> for example :

1. firstName = undefined (type: undefined)
2. lastName = undefined (type: undefined)
3. age = undefined (type: undefined)
4. yearOfBirth = undefined (type: undefined)


It will ignore the console.log lines , and check only line having let , var and const declaration.

-> after memory creation phase , when all variable reserved space in memory with undefined value , then the next phase will be CODE EXECUTION PHASE.


======================================= CODE EXECUTION PHASE

1. firstName = "Ahmed" (type: string)
2. lastName = "Mustafa"  (type: string)
3. age = 15 (type: num)
4. yearOfBirth = 2000 (type: num)
