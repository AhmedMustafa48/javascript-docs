=======================================  VISUALIZE MEMORY CREATION PHASE 

All variables will reserve space in memory with "undefined" value. 
It will ignore the console.log lines , and check only line having let , var and const declaration.

-> after memory creation phase , when all variable reserved space in memory with undefined value , then the next phase will be CODE EXECUTION.
