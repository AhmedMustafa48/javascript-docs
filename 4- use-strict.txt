rules in which "use strict" works

- variable declaration
- can't delete the variable
- can't make same parameters in functions

without "use strict"
compiler will not give error in console of undeclare variable.   (a = 2;)
not give the error of irrelevent deletion of variable. (delete a;) => this keyword not delete the variable , it delete the object ... and without use-strict console wll not show the error 
not give of parameters mistake of function ( e.g. function hello(a,b,b){} )



you just need to write "use strict" at the top of the file , then you wll get all the errors in console, otherwise you will not see error if occur.
